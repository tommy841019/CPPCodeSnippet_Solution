/*
	The Basic Steps
		1. Make sure you understand the problem
		2. When you understand the question, try a simple example
		3. Focus on the algorithm and data structures you will use to solve the problem
			“I’m wondering whether I can store the values in an array and then sort them, but I don’t think that will work because I can’t quickly look up elements in an array by value.”
		4. After you figure out your algorithm and how you can implement it, explain your solution to the interviewer
